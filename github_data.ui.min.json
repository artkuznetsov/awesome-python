For that purpose we will use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network, as generator, and a Convolutional Neural Network, CNN, as a discriminator. We use LSTM for the obvious reason that we are trying to predict time series data. Why we use GAN and specifically CNN as a discriminator? That is a good question: there are special sections on that later.","_age_weeks":225,"category":"finance","_topics":[],"sim":[["ydataai/ydata-synthetic",0.53,"data",0],["sdv-dev/sdv",0.51,"data",0]],"_readme_localurl":"borisbanushev~stockpredictionai~readme.md"},{"githuburl":"https://github.com/pylons/webob","_reponame":"webob","_organization":"pylons","_homepage":"https://webob.org/","_pop_score":27.74,"_stars":425,"_stars_per_week":0.7,"_description":"webob: WSGI request and response objects","_age_weeks":606,"category":"web","_topics":[],"sim":[["pallets/werkzeug",0.63,"web",0],["pylons/waitress",0.56,"web",0],["benoitc/gunicorn",0.52,"web",0]],"_readme_localurl":"pylons~webob~README.rst"},{"githuburl":"https://github.com/arxiv-vanity/arxiv-vanity","_reponame":"arxiv-vanity","_organization":"arxiv-vanity","_homepage":"https://www.arxiv-vanity.com","_pop_score":27.67,"_stars":1429,"_stars_per_week":4.79,"_description":"arxiv-vanity: Renders papers from arXiv as responsive web pages so you don't have to squint at a PDF.","_age_weeks":298,"category":"nlp","_topics":["latex","academic-publishing","science","arxiv"],"sim":[["lukasschwab/arxiv.py",0.54,"util",1]],"_readme_localurl":"arxiv-vanity~arxiv-vanity~README.md"},{"githuburl":"https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye","_reponame":"birdseye","_organization":"alexmojaki","_homepage":"https://birdseye.readthedocs.io","_pop_score":27.66,"_stars":1545,"_stars_per_week":5.12,"_description":"birdseye: Graphical Python debugger which lets you easily view the values of all evaluated expressions","_age_weeks":301,"category":"debug","_topics":["python-debugger","debugger","debugging","birdseye","ast"],"sim":[["alexmojaki/snoop",0.6,"debug",2],["alexmojaki/heartrate",0.55,"debug",1],["gaogaotiantian/viztracer",0.54,"profiling",1],["facebook/pyre-check",0.51,"typing",0],["agronholm/typeguard",0.51,"typing",0],["google/pytype",0.51,"typing",0]],"_readme_localurl":"alexmojaki~birdseye~README.rst"},{"githuburl":"https://github.com/ibm/transition-amr-parser","_reponame":"transition-amr-parser","_organization":"ibm","_homepage":"","_pop_score":27.59,"_stars":187,"_stars_per_week":1.0,"_description":"transition-amr-parser: SoTA Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing with word-node alignments in Pytorch.
